## 1. Project Description 
- [Link to the web application](http://13.58.22.177:8080/Jupiter/)
- Frontend: an interactive web page with `AJAX` technology implemented with `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. This web application supports 3 major implementations:
   * **Auto-Search** events around users based on geolocation
   * **Favorite** events when the user likes while **Unfavorite** events when user unlikes the events
   * Show **recommendation of events** around based on their favorite history
- Backend: create `Java` servlet with `RESTful APIs` in `Apache Tomcat` to handle HTTP requests and responses
   * Utilized relational and NoSQL databases (MySQL/MongoDB) to store real business data, such as name, description, location and price, from TicketMaster API
   * Design **content-based recommendation algorithm** for event recommendation
   * Deployed server to Amazon EC2 to handle 160 QPS tested by Apache JMeter 

## 2. Infrastructure Design
- 3-tier architecture
   * Presentation tier: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   * Data tier: MySQL, MongoDB
   * Logic tier: Java
- Local and remote development environment

> Local development environment

![remote environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonSulong/EventRecommendation/master/img/remote.png)
> Remote development environment

## 3. Java Servlet Design
- Logic tier(Java Servlet to RPC)
   * Search
      * searchItems
      * Ticketmaster API
      * parse and clean data, saveItems
      * return response
   * History
      * get, set, delete favorite items
      * query database
      * return response
   * Recommendation
      * recommendItems
      * get favorite history
      * search similar events, sorting
      * return response
   * Login
      * GET: check if the session is logged in
      * POST: verify the user name and password, set session time and marked as logged in
      * query database to verify
      * return response
   * Logout
      * GET: invalid the session if exists and redirect to `index.html`
      * POST: the same as GET
      * return response
   * Register
      * Set a new user into users table/collection in database
      * return response

![APIs design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonSulong/EventRecommendation/master/img//APIs.png)
> APIs design in logic tier

- TicketMasterAPI
[Official Doc - Discovery API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/)
- Recommendation Algorithms design
   * **Content-based Recommendation**: find categories from item profile from a user’s favorite, and recommend the similar items with same categories.
   * Present recommended items with ranking based on distance (geolocation of users)

> Process of recommend request

## 4. Database Implementation
- MySQL
   * **users** - store user information.
   * **items** - store item information.
   * **category** - store item-category relationship
   * **history** - store user favorite history

![mysql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonSulong/EventRecommendation/master/img/mysql.png)
> MySQL database design

- MongoDB
   * **users** - store user information and favorite history. = (users + history)
   * **items** - store item information and item-category relationship. = (items + category)
   * **logs** – store log information

## 5. Design pattern
   * **Builder pattern**: `Item.java`
      * When convert events from TicketMasterAPI to java Items, use builder pattern to freely add fields.
   * **Factory pattern**: `ExternalAPIFactory.java`, `DBConnectionFactory.java`
      * `ExternalAPIFactory.java`: support multiple function like recommendation of event, restaurant, news, jobs… just link to different public API like TicketMasterAPI. Improve extension ability.
      * `DBConnectionFactory.java`: support multiple database like MySQL and MongoDB. Improve extension ability.
   * **Singleton pattern**: `MySQLConnection.java`, `MongoDBConnection.java`
      * Only create specific number of instance of database, and the class can control the instance itself, and give the global access to outerclass
